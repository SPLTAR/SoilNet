### Simple R code to import and clean up data from the Soil Network of sensors.
By: Stephen Teet

  Code originally written in R for cleaning up the data coming in from the pasture 13 (P13) Soil Network.  R code later (to be) added for the WRE Soil Network data.

  * SoilNetClean.R processes data from the standard P13 soil sensor stations.
  * SoilNetClean_2Stations.R processes data form the P13 soil sensor stations that have two sets of sensors attached, i.e. represent two stations.
  * SoilNetCleanWRE.R (will) process data from the WRE soil sensor stations.
